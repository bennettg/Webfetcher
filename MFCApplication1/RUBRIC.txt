Use of Constants: Yes - using #define to make preprocessor functions and for strings used throughout the code, see bottom of stdafx.h
Use of Variables: Yes - lots of them
Use of Arrays: Yes - I used a vector to store the comma delimited urls,files
Use of Methods: Yes - I use lots of methods mostly in classes, but 1 outside (see functions.cpp)
Use of Classes: Yes - I use many classes see Webfetcher.h,Webfetcher.cpp and all of the Application dialogs classes I also modified functions within their created classes
Use of Inheritance: No
Use of Loops: Yes - To loop through the vectors that would store multiple files/urls to download them for each element (if more than one exists)
Use of Conditional Statements: Yes
Use of Method Overloading: No

Thank you!
